<h1 align="center">Welcome to NC News! üëã</h1>


This is a social news forum site, where users are able to interact, rate content and discuss topics with others, similarly to Reddit. 
The articles are served up from my NC News API that I had made for my backend project:

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Run Project

You can now run the project:

```sh
$ npm run dev
```
